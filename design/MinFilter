A MinFilter is a generic Filter that filters the input data for the minimum value
since initialization or the last reset. A comparator is used for comparing values
in the MinFilter.

    // The minimum value found thus far.
    A min;

    /**
     * Filters the minimum input value since the filter was initialized or
     * was last reset.
     *
     * @param value - the value to filter
     * @return the minimum seen by the filter thus far as type B
     */
    public B filter(A value) {
        check that value is not null

        if value is less than min
            min <- value

        return min as type B
    }

    /**
     * Resets the filter with the specified value.
     *
     * @param value - the value to reset the filter with
     */
    public void reset(A value){
        min <- value
    }
