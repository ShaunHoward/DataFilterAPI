A FIRFilter is a ScalarLinearFilter with a(0,1) <- 0
and M initialized to 0. Summation of the output portion of
the linear equation of a scalar linear filter is ignored
in a FIR Filter.

     * Constructs a scalar linear filter with input boundary coefficient N
     * and list of multipliers b for input.
     * The list of multipliers for the output, a, are all initialized to 0.
     * The boundary coefficient for the output, M, is set to 0 since summation
     * of output does not take place in a FIR filter.

     * @param N - the input boundary coefficient
     * @param b - the multiplier list for input
