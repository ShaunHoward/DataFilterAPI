EECS293 Project 11 Design Document - Shaun Howard (smh150)

Given the assignment document, I have developed the following design for the
filter system.


Filter - which will have generic input and output types
A filter repeatedly takes an input value and returns an output value.

Scalar Filter - which is a type of Filter
Identity Filter - which is a type of Scalar Filter with scale 1
Max Filter N - which is a type of Filter that has a maximum determined by a Comparator
Max Filter - which is a type of Max Filter N with N as infinity
Min Filter N - whih is a type of Filter that has a minimum determined by a Comparator
Min Filter - which is a type of Min Filter N with N as infinity
Averaging Filter N - which is a type of Scalar Filter that gets the average of input
Averaging Filter - which is a type of Averaging Filter N with N as infinity
Scalar Linear Filter - which is a type of Filter
FIR Filter - which is a type of Scalar Linear Filter
Gain Filter - which is a type of FIR Filter
Binomial Filter - which is a type of FIR Filter
Filter Cascade - which is a type of Filter that takes multiple Filters
