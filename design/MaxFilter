A MaxFilter is a generic Filter that filters the input data for the maximum value
since initialization or the last reset. A comparator is used for comparing values
in the MaxFilter.

    // The maximum value found thus far.
    A max;

    /**
     * Filters the maximum input value since the filter was initialized or
     * was last reset.
     *
     * @param value - the value to filter
     * @return the maximum seen by the filter thus far as type B
     */
    public B filter(A value) {
        check that value is not null

        if value is greater than max
            max <- value

        return max as type B
    }

    /**
     * Resets the filter with the specified value.
     *
     * @param value - the value to reset the filter with
     */
    public void reset(A value){
        max <- value
    }
